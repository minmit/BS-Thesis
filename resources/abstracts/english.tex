Motivated by a bus routing application, 
we study the following \emph{rectangle escape} problem: 
Given a set $S$ of $n$ rectangles inside a rectangular region named \emph{board}, extend each rectangle in $S$ toward one of the four borders of the board so that the maximum density over the board is minimized, 
where the density of each point $p$ of the board is defined as the number of extended rectangles containing $p$.

We show that the problem is hard to approximate to within any factor better than ${{3} \over {2}}$. 
When the desired density is $1$, we provide an exact algorithm that finds an optimal solution in $O(n^4)$ time, 
improving upon the current best $O(n^6)$-time algorithm. 
When the optimal density is sufficiently large, 
for any constant $\epsilon > 0$, we provide a randomized algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of $1 + \epsilon$ with high probability improving upon the current best 4-approximation algorithm available for the problem.
